sfUnobstrusiveWidgetPlugin
=================

The `sfUnobstrusiveWidgetPlugin` packages useful widgets for symfony.


Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony uo-widget:publish

  * Clear the cache

        $ symfony cache:clear

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is disponibel in the directory "doc", but I encourage you to look at the code phpdoc for other information.

As no third party libraries is bundled in the plugin, you need to install and load the required
dependencies like JQuery or JQuery UI by yourself.


This plugin is fully compatible with sfDynamicsPlugin (http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfDynamicsPlugin).
