# learn by example - wym editor

As WYMeditor (http://www.wymeditor.org/) is not bundled in the plugin, you need to install and load the required dependencies by yourself.


## create widget

$wymEditor = sfUoWidgetFormTextarea(array(
  'js_transformer'=>'wym_editor'
));


## render widget

$wymEditor->render('');
