# learn by example - swf upload

As it's just a widget, you need to create an action to received the swfUpload file and a specific validator.
Fortunately there is already a plugin for it : sfUploadManagerPlugin (http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfUploadManagerPlugin)


## create widget

$swfUpload = new sfUoWidgetFormInputFile(array(
  'js_transformer' => 'swf_upload',
  'js_config'      => array('upload_url' => url_for($route), 'file_post_name' => 'file'),
  )
);


## render widget

$swfUpload->render('widget_name');
