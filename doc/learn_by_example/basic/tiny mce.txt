# learn by example - tiny mce

As tinyMCE (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/index.php) is not bundled in the plugin, you need to install and load the required dependencies by yourself.


## create widget

$tinyMce = sfUoWidgetFormTextarea(array(
  'js_transformer'=>'tiny_mce'
));


## render widget

$tinyMce->render('form_field_name');
