sfUnobstrusiveWidgetPlugin is an attempt to use javascripts best pratices development in a symfony project.
The main idea :
HTML is the language of the web, it works everywhere (pretty much). Images, CSS, Javascript, Flash are all extras that will break (badly) somewhere. Everyone should be able to get a usable, functional experience some get an even better one.
You can use JavaScript for nice extras, though However Without JavaScript the page will become less user-friendly. Can't be helped. After all, the purpose of JavaScript is to add interactivity to a page.

All widget have to work :
 - without JS orCSS 
 - with Keyboard 
 - with Mouse 

Two fundamental principles: 
  1. Separation of structure, presentation, and behavior 
    - Separation of HTML and CSS (No inline styles)
    - Separation of HTML and JavaScript (No inline event handlers)
  2. The script doesn't assume anything


We figth some uggly idea like :
  1. "JavaScript is always available" -> FALSE
    - Primitive cell phones don't support it (sufficiently)
    - Speech browsers' support may be spotty 
    - Company networks may filter out <script> tags
  2. "Everybody uses a mouse" -> FALSE
    - Device independence
    - Generally, keyboard users need more actions to achieve the same goals as mouse users. Don't interfere too much. There are reasons for this behavior, and keyboard users are used to it.


To the question :
Do I need to support ___ on this project?

we answered : 

1. We need a realistic definition of Support 
  - "Support" does not equal to "identical"
  - "Support" means "content is available" 
  - Expecting two users using different browser software to have an identical experience fails to embrace or acknowledge the heterogeneous essence of the Web

2. "Support" is not binary. There are 3 grades of browser support.
  - C-gradesupport (core support, 2%) 
  - A-gradesupport (advanced support, 96%) 
  - X-gradesupport (the X-Factor, 2%)
